# Robo 6
Robo 6 is the name of a project that we are working on at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - Hagenberg - in the course "Introduction to Software Project Management". Here we program a Lego Mindstorms robot in Java using the Lejos API to control the EV3 Brick on the robot. The robot should be capable of driving semi-autonomously and push legobricks off the table.
